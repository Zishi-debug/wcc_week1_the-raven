            Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
            And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
                Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
                From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
            For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
                        Nameless here for evermore.
